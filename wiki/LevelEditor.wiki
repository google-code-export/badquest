#summary Planned features and tools for the level editor
#labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

The level editor will allow a user or developer to import or export room designs, as well as provide an interface for modifying tile layouts and arranging entities.

= Revision History =

Kept in a double-ended queue for undoing and redoing. If memory becomes an issue, consider temporarily dumping history into a file, then loading and unloading as necessary.

= Tools =

Things like brushes and selectors.

== Radial Brush ==

Insert tiles up to a specified radius away from the brush. There could be an "outline" mode in which a secondary tile is used to outline the stroke's silhouette.

== Flood Fill ==

Select a tile type and a tile already in the level. The selected tile and all of its connected neighbors of the same type will become the selected type.
